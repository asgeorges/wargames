# wargames

## Description

The wargames project leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) for optimization in simulated strategic environments. This framework aims to learn and adapt from historical outcomes, optimizing decision-making and resource allocation dynamically.

## Motivation

Combining RL and GA harnesses the adaptability of learning from an environment with the robustness of evolutionary search strategies, making it ideal for complex optimization problems in strategic simulations.

## Theoretical Background

### Reinforcement Learning (RL)

RL involves an agent learning to make decisions to achieve goals, based on feedback from the environment.

### Genetic Algorithms (GA)

GAs are based on the principles of natural selection and genetics, used for solving optimization and search problems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.x)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package installer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

To clone the project repository, open a terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal application) and run the following command:


`git clone https://github.com/asgeorges/wargames.git` 

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd wargames`

`python -m venv wargamesenv`


`source wargamesenv/bin/activate`


#### 3. Install Dependencies

You will need to manually install any dependencies as you work on the project. When you encounter a missing package, install it using pip:



`pip install package_name`


Replace `package_name` with the name of the Python package you need. This approach ensures you only install what's necessary for your project.

#### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook 

Start Jupyter Notebook with:

`jupyter notebook`


Then, navigate to the `.ipynb` file within the Jupyter Notebook interface to open it.

### Running the Notebook

To run a notebook cell, select it and press `Shift + Enter`. Repeat this for each cell you wish to execute.

## Resolving Environment Dependencies

If you run into issues with missing packages or dependencies, make sure you've activated your virtual environment and install any missing packages as described in step 3.
